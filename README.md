A 60% through-hole keyboard using a Pro Micro and an MCP23017 IO expander.

## Why?

Good question... 

I had an extra Pro Micro laying around from a macropad build that I did, and I also had recently worked with the MCP23017 in a separate embedded project. Put the two together and I decided to make a fully through-hole keyboard to have some fun with KiCAD and Fusion 360. It gave me something to do over winter break too. 

## Design Process

Before starting the PCB, I decided to draw up the schematic and create a breadboard circuit with everything I wanted on the board. This also allowed me to make sure my firmware was correct so that when I wouldn't have to wait a week or two for my order to come in to start testing the board.

After this, I went to KiCAD to design the schematic and layout.
